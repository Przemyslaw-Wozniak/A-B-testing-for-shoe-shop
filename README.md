# Project summary

The aim of this project is to use pandas to get insights about preferences over two versions of website. The shoe shop has two different versions of an ad, which owners have placed in emails, as well as in banner ads on Facebook, Twitter, and Google. They want to know how the two ads are performing on each of the different platforms on each day of the week.
